Withdrawing TRAC from your node profile will send the TRAC to your management wallet.\nThe maximum amount of TRAC safe to withdraw is shown in the left sidebar. Keep in mind that if you withdraw all TRAC available, your node will not be able to respond to new offers because it will not be able to stake TRAC for the job.
